Hi, I’m Tiago.

I’m an engineer and economist with a strong appetite for solving challenges that matter. Be it in technology, product, or operations, I get down to brass tacks wherever needed to deliver business value. 

My technical background spans software and electrical engineering, statistics, econometrics, robotics and deep learning, giving me a versatile toolkit for building scalable solutions.

Currently, I’m developing cutting-edge perception software at [CRON AI](https://cronai.ai).

When I'm not working, I enjoy making music, riding and working on motorcycles, and high-intensity sports.

Feel free to reach out!
