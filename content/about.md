Hi,

My name is Tiago.

Iâ€™m a portuguese software engineer focusing on deep learning.

Currently, I am building bleeding edge perception software at [CRON AI](https://cronai.ai/).

Concurrently, I am finishing a Master's degree in Economics at ISEG, Portugal's leading public university in economics.

These days I work mostly with Python, Pytorch and e-mail :grin:.

I like music, motorcycles and fighting sports.
